## üìÑ Overview

**SecureAuth Pro**, developed by Adrian Lesniak, is a robust C++ console-based user management system. It provides essential functionalities including user registration (with the first user automatically designated as an administrator), secure login authentication, password change capabilities, and an admin-exclusive feature to list all registered users. The system emphasizes security through password hashing (using `std::hash` for demonstration purposes) and persists user data in `users.dat`. All significant system events and user actions are meticulously logged to `system.log`. Designed with an object-oriented approach utilizing `UserManager` and `Logger` classes, it features a colorful Windows-specific console interface for an enhanced user experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üë§ **User Account Management**:
    *   `registerUser`: Securely create new user accounts. The first user registered automatically gains administrator privileges.
    *   `login`: Authenticate users based on their username and password.
    *   `changePassword`: Allows authenticated users to update their passwords after verifying their current one.
    *   `listUsers`: An **admin-only** function to display a list of all registered usernames, clearly marking administrators.
*   üîí **Security Measures**:
    *   `hashPassword`: Implements password hashing using `std::hash` (Note: suitable for demonstration, not production-grade security).
    *   **Data Persistence**: Securely stores user credentials (username, password hash, admin status) in a binary or structured text file (`users.dat`).
*   üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Console Interface**:
    *   `displayHeader`: Presents a clear program title, author details, and a summary of features.
    *   `displayMenu`: Offers a user-friendly menu with options for registration, login, password change, user listing, and exit.
    *   **Colorful Output**: Utilizes Windows console API (e.g., `SetConsoleTextAttribute`) for distinct colors (cyan, yellow, green, red, white) to improve UI clarity.
*   ‚úçÔ∏è **System Event Logging**:
    *   **Logger Class**: A dedicated `Logger` class records important system events (e.g., user registrations, login attempts - successful and failed, password changes) to `system.log` with precise timestamps.
*   üóÉÔ∏è **File Handling**:
    *   `loadUsers`: Efficiently reads user data from `users.dat` upon application startup.
    *   `saveUsers`: Persists updated user data to `users.dat` before exiting or after critical changes.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Robust Operation**:
    *   The main program loop handles user input (via `_getch` for immediate keypress response) and dispatches actions.
    *   Incorporates `try-catch` blocks for graceful error handling, with errors also logged.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Operating System**: Windows (due to dependencies like `<windows.h>` for `SetConsoleTextAttribute` and `<conio.h>` for `_getch`).
*   **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, MSVC).
*   **Standard C++ Libraries**: `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<functional>` (for `std::hash`).
*   **Write Permissions**: The application needs write permissions in its execution directory to create/modify `system.log` and `users.dat`.

## üß© Core Components & Headers

*   **`user_manager.hpp`**: (User-provided or part of the project) Header file declaring the `UserManager` class (responsible for all user-related logic like add, find, authenticate, save/load users) and likely a `User` struct/class (to hold username, password hash, admin status).
*   **`user_manager.cpp`**: (User-provided or part of the project) Implementation file for the `UserManager` class methods.
*   **`logger.hpp`**: (User-provided or part of the project) Header file declaring the `Logger` class for writing timestamped messages to `system.log`.
*   **`main.cpp`**: The main application file containing the UI logic, menu handling, and interaction with `UserManager` and `Logger`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details)

2.  **Ensure Header and Source Files are Present**:
    *   Verify that `user_manager.hpp`, `user_manager.cpp` (implementation), and `logger.hpp` (and its potential `.cpp` implementation) are correctly placed in the project directory as per your project's structure.
    *   The main application logic should be in `main.cpp`.

3.  **Compile the Program**:
    Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.) in the project directory.
    **Example using g++ (MinGW):**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp user_manager.cpp logger.cpp -o login_system.exe -std=c++11 -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
    ```
    *(Adjust the command if `logger.cpp` is not needed (header-only logger) or if you have other source files. Ensure your compiler flags are appropriate, e.g., `-std=c++11` or newer).*

4.  **Run the Program**:
    ```bash
    .\login_system.exe
    ```
    (or `login_system.exe` in CMD)

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  Compile and run `login_system.exe` as detailed above.
2.  **Interface**:
    *   The program will display a header and a main menu with the following options:
        1.  Register new user
        2.  Login
        3.  Change password
        4.  Display all users (Admin only)
        5.  Exit
3.  **Input**:
    *   Select a menu option (1‚Äì5) using a single keypress (handled by `_getch`).
    *   **Registration/Login/Password Change**: You will be prompted to enter a username and password(s) as required.
    *   The system provides feedback for invalid inputs (e.g., if a username already exists during registration, or if login credentials are incorrect).
    *   **List Users (Option 4)**: If logged in as an admin, this will display all registered usernames, indicating which ones have admin privileges (e.g., "user1 (Admin)", "user2").
4.  **Output**:
    *   **Registration**: "Registration successful!" or an error like "Username already exists!".
    *   **Login**: "Login successful! Welcome, [username]!" or "Invalid username or password!".
    *   **Password Change**: "Password changed successfully!" or an error like "Invalid username or current password!".
    *   **User List**: A formatted list of users.
    *   All significant events are logged with timestamps to `system.log`.
    *   User data is persisted in `users.dat`.
5.  **Actions**:
    *   After most operations, you will be prompted to press any key to return to the main menu.
    *   Select option `5` to save data and exit the application.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure & Data Persistence

*   `main.cpp`: Core application logic, UI, and menu handling.
*   `user_manager.hpp` & `user_manager.cpp`: Defines and implements the `UserManager` class for all user data operations.
*   `logger.hpp` (& `logger.cpp` if applicable): Defines and implements the `Logger` class for event logging.
*   `system.log`: A plain text file where system events (registrations, logins, errors, etc.) are logged with timestamps. This file is created or appended to.
*   `users.dat`: A data file (format could be binary, CSV, or custom plain text) that stores user information: typically username, hashed password, and an admin status flag. This file is read at startup and written to on exit or after critical changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note (Password Hashing)

The current implementation uses `std::hash` for password hashing. While suitable for demonstration and learning, **`std::hash` is NOT cryptographically secure and should NOT be used for storing passwords in a production environment.** For real-world applications, robust, salted hashing algorithms like **bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2** are strongly recommended.

## üìù Technical Notes

*   **Windows Specifics**: The project leverages Windows-specific headers (`<windows.h>`, `<conio.h>`) for functionalities like colored console output (`SetConsoleTextAttribute`) and direct keypress input (`_getch()`). Adapting for true cross-platform use would require alternative libraries or conditional compilation for these features (e.g., ANSI escape codes for colors, ncurses or similar for advanced console I/O).
*   **Object-Oriented Design**: The use of `UserManager` and `Logger` classes promotes modularity and better code organization.
*   **Admin Functionality**: The first registered user is designated as an admin. Admin privileges are currently limited to listing users. This could be expanded (e.g., delete user, reset password).
*   **Error Handling**: `try-catch` blocks are used for exception handling, with errors being logged for diagnostics.
